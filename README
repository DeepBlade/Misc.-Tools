Miscellaneous Tools
author: Kelvin Ng (deepblade@gmail.com)

This is a repository of miscellaneous useful tools that I've created.
I've written these on my Mac, so assume that they only work in Mac OSX for now.

- copyRobot is a Python script that automates copying contents of a CD or DVD
  to a target directory. This will help in eliminating physical media.

- imageRobot is a Python script that automates the imaging process of
  a CD or DVD to a target directory. Again, this is to help the process
  of eliminating physical media.
